# PicoCompress
## PicoCompress lets you clean your pico-8 code so it will reduce the memory size

* It removes (--,//)comments,newlines and multiline comments for now
* it will still reduce %memory and char count not token count but i am working on other things that will.

## Usage
* put your pico-8 code inside input folder as txt file ("copy and paste it into a txt file")

* Run the script the output will be "your_file_name"_output.txt
