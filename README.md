## picoClear

#picoClear lets you clean your pico-8 code so it will reduce the memory size

* It only removes (--,//)comments,newlines and multiline comments for now for now it will still reduce %memory and char count not token count but i am working on other things like shortening the if statetment and such more in the todo list in python script.
